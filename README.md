# Personal Portfolio Website

## Intro
This portfolio showcases my journey as a developer, designed to be fun, dynamic, and modern. I've incorporated 3D effects using `Three.js` and `Spline` to create an engaging user experience, highlighting my work and experiences in web development.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** `React`, `Tailwind CSS`, `CSS`
- **3D Libraries:** `Three.js`, `Spline`
- **Hosting:** `GitHub Pages`

## Features
- **Home Screen:** Features dynamic text animation and interactive 3D effects to captivate visitors immediately as well as an Introduction and quick navigation to different sections.
- **Projects:** A detailed showcase of my projects, including descriptions, technologies used, and links to live sites or GitHub repositories.
- **About Me:** An insight into my journey, skills, and professional background.
- **Contact Me:** An innovative, playful, and interactive command terminal-themed design, inviting users to reach out in a fun way.

## Process
The development process began with prototyping the site's layout and user experience in Figma, emphasizing a fun, dynamic, and modern design. Implementing the front end with React and Tailwind CSS, I integrated 3D effects with `Three.js` and `Spline` to create an engaging visual experience. The primary challenge was ensuring the site's responsiveness across various devices while maintaining the integrity of complex animations and effects.

## Learnings
This project significantly improved my proficiency in React and Tailwind CSS, deepening my understanding of creating responsive and interactive web components. Working with `Three.js` and `Spline` taught me the intricacies of incorporating 3D elements into web interfaces, enhancing user engagement through visual effects. Deploying the site on GitHub Pages offered valuable insights into web hosting and accessibility.

## Improvement
Future updates will focus on adding more interactive elements and possibly a blog section to share insights and experiences in web development. Optimizing site performance, especially the loading times of 3D assets, is a priority to enhance user experience further.
